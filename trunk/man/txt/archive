USAGE:

	archive create [path/to/folder] [archiveName]

DESCRIPTION:
 archive is an internal ADORE function. 
 It creates a tar archive for the given folder, as well as creating checksums 
 (md5sum) for each file. 
 The extract option is used to extract the archives to the current directory.
 The recorded checksums during archive process are verified during extraction.
 In addition, the paths are corrected in the DORIS input and output files 
 using mvDorisFiles.

   command requires the archive file to be passed as the first parameter.
