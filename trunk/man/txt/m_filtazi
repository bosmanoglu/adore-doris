USAGE:
 m_filtazi

DESCRIPTION:
 M_FILTAZI is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name. 

 This optional step filters the spectrum of the master in azimuth direction.
The part of the spectrum that does not overlap with the spectrum of the
slave is filtered out. This non overlap is due to the selection of a Doppler
centroid frequency in the SAR processing, which normally is not equal for
master and slave image. This step can in general best be performed after the 
COARSE coregistration and before the FINE.

INPUT:
 There are no required input parameters for this command.
  
 OPTIONAL:

OUTPUT:
