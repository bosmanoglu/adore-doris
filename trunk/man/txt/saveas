USAGE:
	saveas exportFormat [optionalParameters] processName

DESCRIPTION:
 SAVEAS is an internal ADORE command. 
 It prepares DORIS results so that they can be opened by other programs. 
 Currently ENVI and ArcGIS are supported. 

INPUT:
 exportFormat: envi, arcgis, gdal, grd. 
 processName: Doris step to be exported.
 
 Optional:
   saveas arcgis [a|p|m] processName
	arcgis export files (HFA, img files) can only have single channel (amplitude, phase or mixed).
      If not specified p(phase) is assumed. This can be used to export amplitude data as well if 
	you do not want to rescale the amplitude values. 
   
   saveas envi processName
      Generates an ENVI header (*.hdr) file for the given input file. 
      If file is complex, both real and imaginary channels can be opened
      in ENVI. Only corner coordinates are used for geocoding. ArcGIS (*.img)
      files can also be opened in ENVI if, geocoding of full image is required.

   saveas gdal a|p|m processName [options for gdal] outputFileName
      Generates a interim file and passes it to gdal_translate. The output
      filename and all other parameters has to be input by the user. 

OUTPUT:
 ENVI:Generates an HDR file with the same name as the output file of the requested doris step (processName).
 ArcGIS: Generates an IMG file.
