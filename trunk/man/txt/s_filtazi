USAGE:

 s_filtazi

DESCRIPTION:
 S_FILTAZI is an ADORE process runs the DORIS step with the same name.  
 Normally the step S_FILTAZI is performed at the same time as M_FILTAZI.
 (PROCESS M_FILTAZI card in input file.) However, we kept this two seperate
 steps to be able to only filter the slave images in a large stack (all
 slaves coregistered on the same master image). This has the advantage that
 for each interferogram of the stack not a large file is created for the
 master. The disadvantage of not filtering the master of course is that a
 small part of the spectrum of the master is not shared with the slave
 spectrum, yielding coherence loss of the interferogram.

INPUT:
