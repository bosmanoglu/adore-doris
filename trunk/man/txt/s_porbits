USAGE:

 s_porbits

DESCRIPTION:
 S_PORBITS is an ADORE process and runs the DORIS step with the same name.  
We use the DEOS fortran program getorb for obtaining the precise orbits.
(This program has to be installed separately, see
http://www.deos.tudelft.nl/ers/precorbs/) This step actually is
only a system call to getorb, and converts the output to a 4 column table:
secofday,x,y,z.
It requires the Orbital Data Records (ODR files) to be in an archive
directory. The arclist file (which should be downloaded together with the
ODR archives) has to be present in this directory. The ODR files have to be
untarred and unzipped as from version 2.5.

INPUT:
 There are no required input parameters for this command.
 
OPTIONAL:
  There are no optional input parameters for this command.

OUTPUT
 Orbit information is written under the precise_orbits step in the result
file.
