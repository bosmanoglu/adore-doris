USAGE:
 subtrrefpha

DESCRIPTION:
 SUBTRREFPHA is an ADORE function and it runs the DORIS step with the same name.  

  In this step the reference phase of a mathematical body (ellipsoid) is
subtracted from the complex interferogram. This is done by complex
multiplication with the conjugated.

INPUT:
 There are no required input parameters for this command.
  
 OPTIONAL:
  There are no optional input parameters for this command.

OUTPUT:
 Two output files are generated:
 *.srp: Reference phase subtracted complex interferogram.
 *.srph2ph: Reference phase output of height-to-phase factors.
