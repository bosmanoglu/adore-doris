USAGE:
 
	deramp dorisStep  
        deramp dorisStep:filename [-o ORDER -e ESTIMATEFILE -m network]

DESCRIPTION:
 DERAMP is an internal ADORE command.  
 It removes a first or second order plane from DORIS results using python, numpy, scipy. 

 The deramp module is located in $ADOREFOLDER/lib/python and has more 
 adjustable parameters compared to this ADORE function.


INPUT:
  * dorisStep[:filename] 
    The step for the output file. Optionally a different file can be specified separated by a colon (:). It can also be used for complex files where a best fitting plane is calculated in frequency domain for the phase. 

  
OPTIONAL:
   * -o ORDER: The order of the polynomial defining the plane. Can be 1 or 2. Default is 1. For complex files this parameter is ignored (i.e. order=1).
   * -e ESTIMATEFILE: When specified this file is subtracted before calculating the best fitting plane. It has to be the same format as the input.
  * -m network: For SBAS style connected networks, a common solution is found after inverting the individually estimated phase ramps. If the ramps are not affecting the phase unwrapping, network deramping in [giant] should be used. 


OUTPUT
  Writes the plane removed result with a `deramp` suffix.

FILES and REFERENCES:

 None.


Example:

  deramp unwrap -o 2 
  deramp unwrap -e ${master}_${slave}.crd
  deramp filtphase 
  deramp filtphase -m network
