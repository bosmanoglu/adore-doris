USAGE:
 
 coregpm 

DESCRIPTION:
 COREGPM is a n ADORE process which runs the DORIS step with the same name. 
 COREGPM (coregistration parameters) computes the polynomial that models the alignment of slave on master.

INPUT:
 There are no required input parameters for this command.
 
OPTIONAL:
  There are no optional input parameters for this command.

OUTPUT
  SUCCESS is printed to STDOUT on successful completion of process
