USAGE:

 m_timing

DESCRIPTION:
 M_TIMING is an ADORE process and runs the DORIS step with the same name.  
 The absolute timing error between DEM and the master is computed using the
simulated amplitude and the result of the coarse coregistration. Therefore,
this step can only be run after the steps M_CROP and M_SIMAMP. The timing
error in azimuth as well as in range direction is estimated. 

INPUT:
 There are no required input parameters for this command.
 
OPTIONAL:
  There are no optional input parameters for this command.

OUTPUT
 Azimuth and range timing errors are written under the master_timing step in
the result file.
