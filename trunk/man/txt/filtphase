 filtphase 

DESCRIPTION:
filtphase is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name. 

This step can be optionally used to filter the (latest) complex interferogram, in order to reduce noise, e.g., for visualization or aiding the phase unwrapping. 
It is probably best run after step SUBTRREFPHA.
