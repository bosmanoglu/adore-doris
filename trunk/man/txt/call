USAGE:
 call "(out1 out2 ... outK)=functionName in1 in2 ... inK ;"

DESCRIPTION:
 CALL is an internal ADORE function to return multiple variables from a BASH 
 function. 

 BASH functions can only return an integer number, and multiple variables can
 only be assigned if variable names are known beforehand. CALL function creates
 the specified output variables in the environment for the given function in
 functionName. The function can have multiple input and output parameters. 
 
 Names of output parameters should be declared in a special variable which 
 starts with the functionName and has the _outputs suffix.
 See "? testFunction" for more details.

INPUT:
 string: A formatted text string has to be passed with the output variables in
  paranthesis. Equal sign separates the output from the function name and 
  input variables follow the function name in typical BASH fashion.
  
 OPTIONAL:
  There are no optional input parameters for this command.

OUTPUT:
 The declared output variables are created returning the output values from the
 function.
