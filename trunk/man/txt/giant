	giant operation [parameters]
        giant prepxml_SBAS
        giant PrepIgramStack
        giant ProcessStack
        giant SBASInvert

DESCRIPTION:
 GIANT is an internal ADORE command.
 It is designed to be an interface between ADORE processing results and Generic InSAR Analysis Toolbox (Piyush A. Shanker, http://earthdef.caltech.edu/).
 

INPUT:
 * `giant prepxml_SBAS`: Generates the xml files (`data.xml` and `sbas.xml` files required by GIAnT.

 * `giant PrepIgramStack`: Generates the input file for all interferograms generated by ADORE and call python code for preparing Interferogram stack with ADORE specific user function. 
  
 * `giant ProcessStack|SBASInvert [parameters]`: These are simple redirection functions, that call GIAnT functions with the same name.


OUTPUT:
  `${runFolder}/giant`: All files related to GIAnT are created in this folder.
