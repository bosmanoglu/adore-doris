 baselines is an ADORE function to provide a shorthand to run baselines.adr
 located in ${ADOREFOLDER}/templates/baselines.adr. It generates a single 
 master stack baseline table and plot using the active ADORE settings. This 
 command is equivalent to run: "p ${ADOREFOLDER}/templates/baselines.adr".

INPUT:

OUTPUT:
 Creates ${projectFolder}/process/${runName}/baselines
 It runs the following DORIS steps:

 If GNUPLOT is installed it creates a baseline plot (eps).
 If IMAGEMAGICK is installed it converts the plot (eps) to a raster image 
 format specified by "raster_format" ADORE variable.
