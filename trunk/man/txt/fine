USAGE:

 fine

DESCRIPTION:
FINE is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name.

The offset vectors to align the slave image to the master are computed with sub pixel accuracy for a number of locations in the master. Over the total image, for a large number of windows (e.g., 500, distributed by Doris or from a file with locations in the master coordinate system), the offset between master and slave is estimated by computing the correlation of the magnitude images for shifts at pixel level.

INPUT:
 There are no required input parameters for this command.
 
OPTIONAL:
  There are no optional input parameters for this command.

OUTPUT
 Results are written in the interferogram result file.
