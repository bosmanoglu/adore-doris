USAGE:

	s_crop2resample

DESCRIPTION:
 S_CROP2RESAMPLE is an internal ADORE command. 
 It is used in creating interferograms coregistered to a different scene, 
 as needed in Small Baselines (SBAS) interferometry. 
 s_crop2resample copies the result of m_ovs or the m_crop as s_resample
 and changes the data_output_file to the s_crop(or s_ovs) output file. 
 Selection between ovs and crop is done automatically. If m_ovs is in the
 process control flag, ovs is used. Otherwise m_crop is used. 
 Master and Slave should be processed in the same way. They both have to 
 be oversampled or not.  

INPUT:
 There are no required input parameters for this command.

OUTPUT
  Modifies the result file by copying the m_crop(m_ovs) to s_resample
