USAGE:

 comprefdem 

DESCRIPTION:
 COMPREFDEM is an ADORE process which runs the DORIS step with the same name. 
 DEM is radarcoded at the grid of the interferogram. In step SUBTRREFDEM it can be subtracted from the complex interferogram.

INPUT:
 There are no required input parameters for this command.
 
OPTIONAL:
  There are no optional input parameters for this command.

OUTPUT
  SUCCESS is printed to STDOUT on successful completion of process.
