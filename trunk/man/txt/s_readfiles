USAGE:

	s_readfiles

DESCRIPTION:
 s_readfiles is a builtin ADORE process.  
 It runs the DORIS step with the same name. 
It is the same as step M_READFILES but then for the slave image. See M_READFILES (? m_readfiles) for more information on this step.
In order to be compatible with official DORIS release v4.02, the current ADORE implementation makes calls for reading Gamma SLC files, if $slcType is specified as gamma. This will be removed when DORIS v4.03 is released, because it will support reading Gamma SLC files within DORIS.
