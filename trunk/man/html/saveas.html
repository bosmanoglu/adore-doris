</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp SAVEAS is an internal ADORE command. <BR>
&nbsp It prepares DORIS results so that they can be opened by other programs. <BR>
&nbsp Currently ENVI and ArcGIS are supported. <BR>
<H3>INPUT</H3>
&nbsp exportFormat: envi, arcgis, gdal, grd. <BR>
&nbsp processName: Doris step to be exported.<BR>
&nbsp <H4>OPTIONAL</H4>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp saveas arcgis [a|p|m] processName<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsparcgis export files (HFA, img files) can only have single channel (amplitude, phase or mixed).<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf not specified p(phase) is assumed. This can be used to export amplitude data as well if <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspyou do not want to rescale the amplitude values. <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp saveas envi processName<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGenerates an ENVI header (*.hdr) file for the given input file. <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf file is complex, both real and imaginary channels can be opened<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspin ENVI. Only corner coordinates are used for geocoding. ArcGIS (*.img)<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspfiles can also be opened in ENVI if, geocoding of full image is required.<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp saveas gdal a|p|m processName [options for gdal] outputFileName<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspGenerates a interim file and passes it to gdal_translate. The output<BR>
