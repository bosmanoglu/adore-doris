&nbsp m_filtazi<BR>
</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp M_FILTAZI is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name. <BR>
&nbsp This optional step filters the spectrum of the master in azimuth direction.<BR>
The part of the spectrum that does not overlap with the spectrum of the<BR>
slave is filtered out. This non overlap is due to the selection of a Doppler<BR>
centroid frequency in the SAR processing, which normally is not equal for<BR>
master and slave image. This step can in general best be performed after the <BR>
COARSE coregistration and before the FINE.<BR>
