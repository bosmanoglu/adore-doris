</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp S_CROP2RESAMPLE is an internal ADORE command. <BR>
&nbsp It is used in creating interferograms coregistered to a different scene, <BR>
&nbsp as needed in Small Baselines (SBAS) interferometry. <BR>
&nbsp s_crop2resample copies the result of m_ovs or the m_crop as s_resample<BR>
&nbsp and changes the data_output_file to the s_crop(or s_ovs) output file. <BR>
&nbsp Selection between ovs and crop is done automatically. If m_ovs is in the<BR>
&nbsp process control flag, ovs is used. Otherwise m_crop is used. <BR>
&nbsp Master and Slave should be processed in the same way. They both have to <BR>
&nbsp be oversampled or not.  <BR>
<H3>INPUT</H3>
&nbsp There are no required input parameters for this command.<BR>
<H3>OUTPUT</H3>
&nbsp &nbspModifies the result file by copying the m_crop(m_ovs) to s_resample <BR>
