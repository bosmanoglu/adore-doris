&nbsp &nbspcoarseorb <BR>
</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp &nbspCOARSEORB is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name. <BR>
&nbsp &nbspThe coregistration based on the orbits of slave and master is computed with an accuracy of about 30 pixels (precise orbits). This is a fast way to get the coarse offsets. Before the FINE coregistration however the step COARSECORR has to be run, in order to get the coarse offsets within a few pixels. (FINE requires the initial estimated offset within a few pixels.)<BR>
