&nbsp MVDORISFILES is an internal ADORE function which modifies Doris Result Files <BR>
&nbsp (*.res) and Doris Input Files (*.drs) by changing locations of the output <BR>
&nbsp files to their current locations. <BR>
&nbsp It is a mere string replacement utility. It does not check for errors.<BR>
&nbsp Each modified file is backed up with a .bck suffix (i.e *.res.bck)<BR>
<H3>INPUT</H3>
&nbsp sourceFolder: The path where the procesing was originally done. This string<BR>
&nbsp &nbspwill be searched and replaced with the destination folder.<BR>
