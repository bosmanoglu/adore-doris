</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp SETTINGS is an internal ADORE command. <BR>
&nbsp It aims at providing a smooth interface for modifying ADORE <BR>
&nbsp settings.<BR>
<H3>INPUT</H3>
&nbsp settings apply [-rq] variableName: updates settings that depend on<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspvariableName. By default this is not done in a recursive way. Use <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp'settings check' for possible mismatches. Settings apply can also assign values <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspusing the variableName=value syntax.  <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp-r: Recursive checks can be specified using -r option. <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp-q: Quiet. Suppresses the printing of the changed settings.<BR>
&nbsp settings check: looks for differences between ADORE's <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspexpectations and current values. Handy for finding <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsperrors due to recursive dependancies.<BR>
&nbsp settings fix: after "check"ing you can accept suggested changes <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspusing the variables. Check will display a reference line.<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp-q: Quiet. Suppresses the printing of the changed settings.<BR>
&nbsp settings init: will ask the user some questions to create an initial <BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspsettings file. Useful when starting a new project. <BR>
&nbsp settings list: will list the current settings as seen by ADORE.<BR>
&nbsp settings raw: displays the unprocessed settings with USERS<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspchanges. This can be saved with the save function.<BR>
&nbsp settings save [fileName]: saves the settings (raw) to the file.<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspif fileName is not specified './settings.set' is used.<BR>
&nbsp settings load [fileName]: loads the settings to the environment.<BR>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspif filenName is not specified './settings.set' is used.<BR>
&nbsp settings reset: initializes the environment. User settings file is loaded.<BR>
&nbsp settings clear: clears all ADORE settings and resets ${ADORESCR} and ${ADOREFOLDER}<BR>
