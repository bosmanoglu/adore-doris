</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp RELTIMING is an ADORE process and runs the DORIS step with the same name.  <BR>
&nbsp &nbspThe relative timing error between the master and slave is computed using<BR>
the (precise) orbits and the result of the fine coregistration. Therefore,<BR>
this step can only be run after the steps COARSE_ORBIT and FINE. The timing<BR>
error in azimuth as well as in range direction is estimated.<BR>
This step is of influence for the coregistration using a DEM ( DEMASSIST<BR>
step). For this coregistration the master and slave images should be aligned<BR>
as good as possible with the DEM. The master is aligned with respect to the<BR>
DEM using a simulated amplitude image (M_TIMING step).<BR>
