</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp S_FILTAZI is an ADORE process runs the DORIS step with the same name.  <BR>
&nbsp Normally the step S_FILTAZI is performed at the same time as M_FILTAZI.<BR>
&nbsp (PROCESS M_FILTAZI card in input file.) However, we kept this two seperate<BR>
&nbsp steps to be able to only filter the slave images in a large stack (all<BR>
&nbsp slaves coregistered on the same master image). This has the advantage that<BR>
&nbsp for each interferogram of the stack not a large file is created for the<BR>
&nbsp master. The disadvantage of not filtering the master of course is that a<BR>
&nbsp small part of the spectrum of the master is not shared with the slave<BR>
&nbsp spectrum, yielding coherence loss of the interferogram.<BR>
