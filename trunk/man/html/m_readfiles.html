<H3>USAGE</H3><PRE>
&nbsp m_readfiles<BR>
</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp m_readfiles is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name. <BR>
&nbsp This is the first step if the ERS1/2 SLC images are processed.The SLC leader, <BR>
&nbsp volume and (header of the) data file are read, and relevant parameters are <BR>
&nbsp written to the master result file specified by the general card M_RESFILE. <BR>
&nbsp These parameters are used in the further processing. Currently, ERS1/2 SLC and<BR>
&nbsp ENVISAT SLC files can be read. If the output of this step is mimicked, Doris <BR>
&nbsp can be tricked to process the other steps. The sole purpose of this step is to<BR>
&nbsp create result file where relevant parameters are stored (PRF, wavelength, <BR>
&nbsp etc.), also see the example in the next section.<BR>
&nbsp In order to be compatible with official DORIS release v4.02, the current ADORE<BR>
&nbsp implementation makes calls for reading Gamma SLC files, if $slcType is <BR>
&nbsp specified as gamma. This will be removed when DORIS v4.03 is released, because <BR>
&nbsp it will support reading Gamma SLC files within DORIS.<BR>
