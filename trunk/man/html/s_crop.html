</PRE><H3>DESCRIPTION</H3>
&nbsp S_CROP is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name.  <BR>
&nbsp In this step the SLC datafile is put on disk in a raw (pixel interleaved,<BR>
2x2byte signed (short) integer complex) format. A few checks are performed<BR>
regarding the number of lines, which is written in the header of the SLC<BR>
data file as well as in the leader file. The image is read/written line by<BR>
line, no data conversion takes place (though a cutout can be made). If you<BR>
are working on a little endian platform (X86 PC) then the data is converted<BR>
from big endian (which is the CEOS format).<BR>
