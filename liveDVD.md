**Thanks for your interest**
So far we ran out all free DVDs. Soon you will be able to order for the reproduction+mailing fee.  I personally contributed 10 free DVDs so far and thanks to the interest it is all gone at the moment. I would still like to keep it free for students but that requires some additional funding.

The link below is for the form to claim free DVDs and I will activate it again when there is enough donations to send one.
