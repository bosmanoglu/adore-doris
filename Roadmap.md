# Proposed features before alpha release #

List of proposed changes in order of importance:
  * **Work in Progress - Need Help** Better manual, additional tutorials.
  * **DONE** Tab completion for all adore commands (i.e. `settings [tab][tab]` should show options for settings command.
  * Add interface to display results. To display the related portion of the result file without opening the file. Visualize coarsecorr, finecorr offsets (turn on visualization using doris+gmt?)
  * **DONE** Add interface to check setup.

# Ideas to consider #
  * A mechanism to report errors easily (i.e. bugreport "failing command") [bugreport on ADDW](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18918772/adore-wiki/index.html#bugreport)
