# USAGE: #
```
	mask processName [maskFile]
    UPCOMING mask generate [coh_threshold]
    UPCOMING mask generate [inputfile lt|gt|eq threshold] 
```
# DESCRIPTION: #
> MASK is an internal ADORE command.
> It is used to generate and apply masks to DORIS products.
# INPUT: #
  * `generate [coh_threshold]`: Generates a mask using the coherence file. Default coherence threshold is 0.4. Alternate thresholds (between 0 and 1) can be specified as a parameter.
  * `generate [inputfile lt|gt|eq threshold]`: Generates a mask using the given input file, operation and threshold. Can be used to generate masks from DEM.
  * `processName`: The default action for mask command is apply. If no ather actions are specified mask reads the connected component mask file generated by snaphu, and masks the given process name (i.e. `interfero, subtrrefpha, subtrrefdem, filtphase`). An alternative mask file can be specified after the `processName`.

# OUTPUT #
> MASK will automatically rename the original DORIS output to
> filename.notmasked
> The masked file will be named as the original output.
