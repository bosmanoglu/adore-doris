Frequently asked questions.

= FAQ  =
*How do I run multiple processing steps?*
  Separate commands with semi-column (`;`). Ex: `m_readfiles;m_porbits;m_crop;m_simamp`  
  
*Does ADORE have tab completion? *
  So far only the variable completion (`$m_res[tab]` completes to `$m_resfile`) and path completion is working.

*How do I remove existing results?*
  There is a command called `undo` to remove steps from result files. It can remove all steps after a given step (default action) or remove only a single step.

*How do I get a list of options the ADORE is using before running the step?*
  You can see what the Doris input files will be like using the show command. If you type `s coarsecorr` it will show you what adore thinks coarsecorr.drs should look like, without running the step.
