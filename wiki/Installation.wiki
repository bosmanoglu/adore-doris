#summary How to install ADORE on Ubuntu.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= From EO-Tools Repository =
You can add the EO-Tools repository to your apt-sources and get the following packages: `adore-doris, doris, getorb, snaphu`<br>
Thanks to *Antonio Valentino* for packaging these applications.

To add the repository:<br>
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:a.valentino/eotools`

To install adore-doris (this should also install doris, getorb and snaphu)<br>
`sudo apt-get install adore-doris`

= Debian Package Installation =
You can download and install the Debian packages under Debian based operating systems including Ubuntu. 

Packages are available here: [http://code.google.com/p/adore-doris/downloads/list]

Once downloaded use your favorite package manager (or simply double-click) on the package file. After the installation is complete you can run adore in a terminal window. 

= Manual Installation of Latest Development Version =

ADORE consists of bash shell scripts and has a simple setup.  

ADORE-DORIS installation consists of three steps. 
  * Dependencies: Installation of dependencies.
  * SVN-Checkout: Checking out latest ADORE-DORIS from the svn. See instructions at: http://code.google.com/p/adore-doris/source/checkout
  * Setup: Setting your path to point to ADORE-DORIS executables (scr) directory.

== Dependencies ==

*Bold* text indicates packages are required for ADORE-DORIS to have some functionality. Optional packages are indicated by _italics_ and they expand the capabilities of ADORE-DORIS. Missing optional packages might cause error messages if a dependent command is issued (for example, if you do not have GDAL and use SAVEAS). 

Code blocks such as {{{ code-block }}} show the command line to install mentioned packages on Ubuntu systems. 

ADORE requires the following packages to be installed on your system:
  * *TU-DELFT DORIS* http://enterprise.lr.tudelft.nl/doris/
    TU-DELFT DORIS is used for all interferometric processing.
  * *GMT* http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/ {{{sudo apt-get install gmt}}}
    GMT is required for TU-DELFT DORIS and ADORE-DORIS uses it in MASK and SAVEAS commands.
  * _GNUPLOT_ http://www.gnuplot.info/ {{{sudo apt-get install gnuplot}}}
    GNUPLOT is used after the BASELINES command to create a post-script (PS) image of the temporal and perpendicular baselines.
  * _Image-Magick_ http://www.imagemagick.org/ {{{sudo apt-get install imagemagick }}}
    Image-Magick is optional, it allows RASTER command to convert images from sun-raster format to supported formats (png, jpg, etc.). 
  * _GDAL_ http://www.gdal.org/ {{{sudo apt-get install gdal-bin}}}
    GDAL is optional, it allows ADORE-DORIS outputs to be exported to ArcGIS via SAVEAS command.


== Setup ==
ADORE-DORIS scripts folder needs to be in your environment PATH. You can do this in ubuntu systems by adding the following lines to the end of your ~/.bashrc file. 

{{{ 
export ADORESCR=/path/to/adore-doris/scr
export PATH=${PATH}:${ADORESCR}
}}}
