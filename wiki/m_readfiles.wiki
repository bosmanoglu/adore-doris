{{{

=DESCRIPTION:=
m_readfiles is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name. 

This is the first step if the ERS1/2 SLC images are processed.The SLC leader, volume and (header of the) data file are read, and relevant parameters are written to the master result file specified by the general card M_RESFILE. These parameters are used in the further processing. If the output of this step is mimicked, Doris 
 can be tricked to process the other steps. The sole purpose of this step is to create result file where relevant parameters are stored (PRF, wavelength,  etc.), also see the example in the next section.

 In order to be compatible with official DORIS release v4.02, the current ADORE implementation makes calls for reading Gamma SLC files, if `$slcType` is specified as `gamma`. This is implemented in DORIS v4.04beta and setting the `$slcType` is no longer necessary.
