=DESCRIPTION:=
SLANT2H is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name.  
  
In this step in principle the heights in the radar coded system are computed. However with the ambiguity method, the geocoding can be done in the same step.

ADORE also supports a "trick" method for geocoding using the DEM. The `crd_out_dem_lp` is linked to `s2h_out_hei` and related lines are added to the interferogram result file. This method can also be executed with the [slant2htrick] command.

=INPUT:=
 There are no required input parameters for this command.
 ==OPTIONAL:==

=OUTPUT=
