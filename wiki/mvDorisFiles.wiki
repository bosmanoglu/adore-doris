=USAGE:=
{{{
 mvDorisFiles sourceFolder destinationFolder
 mvDorisFiles -s "/exact/path/to/source/Folder" destinationFolder
}}}
=DESCRIPTION:=
 MVDORISFILES is an internal ADORE function which modifies Doris Result Files 
 (*.res) and Doris Input Files (*.drs) by changing locations of the output 
 files to their current locations. 
 It is a mere string replacement utility. It does not check for errors.
 Each modified file is backed up with a .bck suffix (i.e *.res.bck)
=INPUT:=
 sourceFolder: The path where the procesing was originally done. This string
  will be searched and replaced with the destination folder.
 destinationFolder: The path where the files are being moved to. This string
  will replace the sourceFolder in the *.res and *.drs files.
 ==OPTIONAL:==
  -s: option is used to update *.res files that are already moved to their
    destination, e.g. scp'ed from a different computer. With this option
    mvDorisFiles only tries to update files without actually moving anything. 
=OUTPUT=
 The files are moved to a new folder and input/output (*.drs/*.res) files
are modified.
