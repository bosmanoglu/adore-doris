=DESCRIPTION:=
 GNUPLOT_BASELINE is an intenal ADORE function to show the calculated
temporal-perpendicular baselines as a scatterplot. It uses gnuplot for the
generation of the image in encapsulated post script (EPS) format. 
=INPUT:=
 baselinesList: The file that contains the data in three colums separated by
space. The order of columns are: temporal baseline, perpendicular baseline,
and orbit names. 
 ==OPTIONAL:==
  There are no optional input parameters for this command.
=OUTPUT=
 Generates an image of the calculated temporal and perpendicular baselines
named baselines.eps.

=EXAMPLE:=

=KNOWN BUGS:=
 Fails when the baselinesList file has bad formatting, which may happen due
to no estimation of perpendicular or temporal baseline. In that case the
baselines file has to be edited manually.
