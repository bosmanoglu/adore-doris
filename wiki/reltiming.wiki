{{{
 reltiming

=DESCRIPTION:=
 RELTIMING is an ADORE process and runs the DORIS step with the same name.  
  The relative timing error between the master and slave is computed using
the (precise) orbits and the result of the fine coregistration. Therefore,
this step can only be run after the steps COARSE_ORBIT and FINE. The timing
error in azimuth as well as in range direction is estimated.
This step is of influence for the coregistration using a DEM ( DEMASSIST
step). For this coregistration the master and slave images should be aligned
as good as possible with the DEM. The master is aligned with respect to the
DEM using a simulated amplitude image (M_TIMING step).
=INPUT:=
