=DESCRIPTION:=
 SETTINGS is an internal ADORE command. <br>
 It aims at providing a smooth interface for modifying ADORE settings.

=INPUT:=
 `settings`:
   will list the current settings as seen by ADORE.

 `settings apply [-r] variableName`: 
  updates settings that depend on variableName. By default this is not done in a recursive way. Use `settings check` for possible mismatches. Recursive checks can be specified using -r option.
  Settings apply can also assign values usign the variableName=value syntax. 

 `settings check`: 
   looks for differences between ADORE's expectations and current values. Handy for finding errors due to recursive dependancies.

 `settings fix`:
   after `settings check`ing you can accept suggested changes using the variables. `settings check` will display a reference line.

 `settings raw`:
   displays the unprocessed settings with USERS	changes. This can be saved with the save function.

 `settings save [fileName]`:
   saves the settings (raw) to the file. If fileName is not specified `./settings.set` is used.

 `settings load fileName`:
   loads the settings to the environment.

 `settings reset`:
   initializes the environment. User settings file is loaded.

 `settings clear`:
   clears all ADORE settings and resets `${ADORESCR}` and `${ADOREFOLDER}`
