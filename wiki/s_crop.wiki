=DESCRIPTION:=
 S_CROP is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name.  
 In this step the SLC datafile is put on disk in a raw (pixel interleaved,
2x2byte signed (short) integer complex) format. A few checks are performed
regarding the number of lines, which is written in the header of the SLC
data file as well as in the leader file. The image is read/written line by
line, no data conversion takes place (though a cutout can be made). If you
are working on a little endian platform (X86 PC) then the data is converted
from big endian (which is the CEOS format).
