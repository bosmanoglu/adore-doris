=DESCRIPTION:=
  COARSEORB is an ADORE process and it runs the DORIS step with the same name. 
  The coregistration based on the orbits of slave and master is computed with an accuracy of about 30 pixels (precise orbits). This is a fast way to get the coarse offsets. Before the FINE coregistration however the step COARSECORR has to be run, in order to get the coarse offsets within a few pixels. (FINE requires the initial estimated offset within a few pixels.)
=INPUT:=
